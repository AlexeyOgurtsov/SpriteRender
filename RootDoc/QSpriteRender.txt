** Rendering algorithm.

All visibles canvasses are rendered back-to-front.

Each canvas is rendered with the following settings:
- Depth stencil is turned off;


** Picking.
Optional functionality that can be disabled.

Pick buffer is a texture, where each texel contains an object id.
Pick buffer is filled in a separate rendering pass.

Separate pass is used because:
- MRT could not be used if MSAA is enabled, because MSAA demands that all RT's are multisampled;
- Can be skipped dynamically if no picking is to be done this frame 
(e.g. inside keyboard-only game picking is performed only when menu is used, 
and only for the menu layer);

Special pixel shader version is used for rendering into the pick-buffer:
- Outputs only object id;
- Optionally discards pixels with alpha below a certain level;

Render state differs from the main pass:
- Blend state is always turned off;

Special object id (zero value) is used to indicate that no pickable object is available at the point.
Each sprite has an assigned object id, or special non-pickable object id, if it's a non-pickable sprite.
Object id is provided by the user at the time of sprite creation.

Each canvas has a flag, indicating whether its sprites can be picked or not.
Non-pickable canvasses are just skipped on the picking pass.
Pickable canvasses are rendered back-to-front as normal.
ATTTENTION! Invisible canvasses DO may be pickable. It may be useful for creating pick proxies, for example.

Pick buffer clearing is performed once before rendering all canvasses by clearing with a special non-pickable object id.
